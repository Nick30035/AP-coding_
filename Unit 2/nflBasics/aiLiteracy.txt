1. Three things humans can do that AI can't or I at least think is change a baby's diaper, digest food 
and pay taxes. Changing a babies diaper is a skill that all parents who have a newly born child should
know how to do or at least learn how to do. Changing a babies diaper requires actually sensing the smell
that the baby needs a new one to begin with and AI doesn't have sense of smell either so that's another
reason.

2. One way AI can be designed to help people is to help people with certain daily tasks or act as maid for certain busy
households. People get busy with their jobs or life in general and the house may get messy and
everything out of place, with the help of the AI maid people will be guaranteed to come back to a nice 
and tidy house. Ai maids would have the ability to sweep, vacuum, fold clothes, basically do anything a 
human would be able to do. A way AI could hurt people however would be like it malfunctioning and 
starting a fire.


3. I believe to intergrate AI into more classrooms, schools should fit AI into their curriculum and 
ongoing lessons certain teachers are teaching. I would also say for some students who may struggle with
understanding learning concepts in person, students could have the ability to have AI powered websites 
that help with explaining or teaching certain subjects more in-depth. Implementing AI into more 
classrooms could teach more students about Digital privacy or things technology related that technology
may not be familiar with.
